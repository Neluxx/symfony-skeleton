# Setup

To set up this project, make sure your system meets the [requirements](Requirements.md). Then follow these steps:

- Checkout the [repository](https://github.com/Neluxx/symfony-skeleton.git).
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Neluxx/symfony-skeleton.git
   ```

- Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd symfony-skeleton
   ```

- Install dependencies with composer.
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

- Start the Symfony built-in server (with [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) installed) to run the application:
   ```bash
   symfony server:start
   ```

The application should now be ready for development.
